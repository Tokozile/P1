		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>Hi. I'm Sibo, a Digital Developer. I have been building relatively simple static web pages via the adobe muse platform.</p>		

		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I'm taking this course to expand my skills and referesh on html/css/javascipt.</p>

		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have a background in web development academically but haven't had much opportunity to use those skills at work. </p>
		<p>I am anticipating having to build a dynamic website in the not too distant future so I am hoping to get a refresher and to learn a lot of new valuable skills that I can easily transfer into the work place.</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I'm working on a pc.</p>

		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>I'm really excited about this class! I'm excited about our instructor and everything I'll be able to learn. I am loving it so far. It's going to be challenging for me but it's exactly what I need at this moment in my career.</p>
