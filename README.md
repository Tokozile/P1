*********DESCRIPTION********

Project one is our connect the dots project. It is allowing us to practice version control, creating droplets,
remoting into servers, setting up domains and redirecting an IP address to a DNS.

Very challenging, but worth the effort. 

*********DEMO**********

Our demo sessions are on Saturday but we don't have to present for this one.
